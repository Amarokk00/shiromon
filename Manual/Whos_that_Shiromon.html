                <h2>On the Subject of Who’s that Shiromon</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Sometimes you don’t really know if it’s a Shiro or a Walter. I hope this will be good training.</p>
                <p>Shiromon may not be active right away, it activates at a random minute.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Walter loves disguising as Shiro, to know if this module hides a Walter, you will have to deduce the Walter Level. Start by counting all Walters.</li>
                    <li>Shiro will try to fight off all Walters, but each strike weakens the Shiro.</li>
                    <li>Thankfully any Walter not grouped will be afraid of an odd number of strikes.</li>
                    <li>Shiro can be powered up if the letters from Shiro are in any indicators or the serial number. Count how many of these letters are in the indicators, and if the serial has at least one.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The power gotten from the serial is immunity from strikes, of course Walters are still affected by it.</li>
                        <li>The power gotten from indicators will strengthen Shiro by multiplying the number of birthday hats by the number of letters.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>Shiro's main strength comes from the number of birthday hats. Using the power of his crown Shiro will steal as many birthdays as the number of hats. Walters with their birthday stolen will die of sadness.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If Shiro went crazy and killed all Walters then Shiro becomes Evil Shiro.</p>
                <p>When the Walter Level is 7 or above you can be sure it’s a sneaky Walter hidden there. Otherwise Shiro probably managed to fight them off without going crazy.</p>
